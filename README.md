# Blackjack
The Python Blackjack game is a text-based implementation of the classic casino card game. It allows a player to engage in a simplified version of Blackjack against a computer dealer. The game is structured using object-oriented programming, with classes for managing cards, a deck of cards, player hands, and handling game logic.

Key Features:

Card Class: This class defines the characteristics of a card, including its rank, suit, and point value.

Deck Class: Represents a standard 52-card deck of playing cards. It initializes the deck, shuffles it, and provides methods for dealing cards.

Hand Class: Manages the player's and dealer's hands of cards, allowing them to receive cards, display their hands, and calculate point values, including handling Ace cards.

Welcome Message: The game starts with a welcoming message, informing the player about the rules and the Blackjack payout ratio.

Money Management: The game offers the player an option to manage their chips, ensuring they have a minimum amount to play.

Game Loop: The game runs in a loop, allowing the player to place bets, receive cards, and make decisions (hit or stand) during their turn.

Dealer Automation: The dealer's actions are automated, with the dealer hitting until their point total reaches 17 or more.

Winning and Losing: The game checks for winning and losing conditions, including the player achieving a Blackjack, busting, or winning based on point totals.

Chip Management: The player can buy more chips if their initial money is insufficient, and their money is updated accordingly.

Play Again: After each round, the player is given the option to play another round or exit the game.
